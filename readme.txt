== Description ==
NGO-menu-deactivate cleans up WordPress admin for sites, remmoves not needed menu items in backoffice, simplifying the backoffice for site admins and site editors. Most settings are based on user permissions, so for super-admin, it does not change much, but for site-admin it cleans up the backoffice a great deal. It also adds a bit of extra security by redirecting users not permitted to edit a post directly to frontoffice, and disables the admin bar for them.
